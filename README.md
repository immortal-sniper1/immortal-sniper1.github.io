# py-power-calculator
read me to learn how to use the calculator
there are 2 types of calculator 
1 is web based 
2 the C++ version

the C++ version is the one that is usualy updated
 first but it is not as user friendly as the web one
 
 To tun this one simply download the executable form :
py_power_calculator\bin\Debug


to run the web based calculator simply download 
the index.html file and open it in a browser
